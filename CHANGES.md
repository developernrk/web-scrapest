## Local Development Setup

The extension can now be run in two modes:

1. **Development Server Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This starts a webpack dev server at http://localhost:9000 where you can test the UI with mock data.

2. **Watch Mode for Chrome Loading**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This builds the extension in development mode and watches for changes, allowing you to load it into Chrome for testing.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist` directory that can be loaded into Chrome.

## How to Load the Extension in Chrome

1. Build the extension using `npm run build` or `npm run dev`
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory
5. The extension should now be installed and visible in your Chrome toolbar

## Next Steps

1. Create icon files in the public/icons directory
2. Add more detailed website analysis features
3. Implement data export functionality
4. Add historical data tracking
5. Add dark mode support using Tailwind
